A molecular biologist I met at an event yesterday asked me to recommend a few books for someone who doesn’t know much about human history or culture. He mentioned that he’d recently enjoyed E.H. Gombrich’s _The Story of Art_. He’d been stunned by it, actually. Through it, he’d glimpsed realms of knowledge that felt completely foreign. This was the kind of book he had in mind -- an accessible introduction, basically, to all of human history. On the spot, I struggled to come up with a list.
There’s Gombrich’s own _A Little History of the World_, but that was published in 1935. Some friends were reading Yuval Noah Harari’s _Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind_ earlier this year, and seemed to enjoy it. Maybe Will and Ariel Durant’s _The Lessons of History_, or Bill Bryson’s _A Short History of Nearly Everything_? Next time, I’ll be ready for the question. It’s just that I’ve never read any of these myself.
