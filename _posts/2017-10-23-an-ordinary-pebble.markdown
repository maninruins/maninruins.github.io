The first page, post, or line of a writing project is a pebble tossed into a boundless ocean. It’s not worth thinking too much about it. Just let it go and see what it does to the surface of the water. It’s so easy, however, to spend a lot of time wandering around on the shore looking for the most interesting stone and waiting for the right moment to throw it. About a year ago, I tried to start a daily blogging habit and kept it up for exactly one day. In some fairness to my former self, I was trying to finish my dissertation at the time, a challenge that was burning up much of my creative energy. My idea about what this blog will be is unclear, and I hope nobody reads it for a while until I figure out what I’m doing. If I post something again tomorrow, I’ll already be doing better than last time!
