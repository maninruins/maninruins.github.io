I recently read two novels by the Norwegian writer Tarjei Vesaas that I can't shake from my mind: 
_The Birds_, from 1957, and _The Ice Palace_, from 1963. His writing style is spare and enigmatic, and 
sometimes has the quality of an obscure myth recorded in an unfamiliar land. I was drawn inside 
the minds of the central characters in a way that is almost unbearably intimate. 
The elements of nature, especially water, play a major role in both novels. The relationship between 
humans and nature builds, gradually and inescapably, towards drama in a way that made my heart 
pound. I'd never heard of Vesaas before seeing his name in an interview with Karl Ove Knausg√•rd that I read this summer.
This continues my journey through Nordic literature. I haven't decided where to go next: 
maybe Per Petterson's _Out Stealing Horses_?
