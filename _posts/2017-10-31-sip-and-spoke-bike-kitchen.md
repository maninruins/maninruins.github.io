There’s so much that I love in [this story](https://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2017/10/30/columbia-road-comfort-station-reborn-bike-shop/sw4iu48RFjIzP466bmkvzK/story.html "Columbia Road comfort station could be reborn as a bike shop"), published in the Globe today, about a man’s effort to convert a century-old abandoned building into a community [bike repair and coffee shop](http://sipandspoke.com "Sip & Spoke Bike Kitchen"). Noah Hicks De Amor grew up in Bowdoin-Geneva, where for
decades shootings have run at rates three or four times greater than other Boston neighborhoods. A [multi-part Globe story](http://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/specials/68blocks "68 Blocks") in 2012 took a long look at the neighborhood’s deep-rooted troubles but also at the optimism and determination of its residents. De Amor embodies those values. As a teenager, he took up bike repair as a hobby. Later, he became a charter-school Latin teacher, but never gave up his work on bikes, eventually
founding the [Bowdoin Bike School](http://www.bowdoinbikeschool.org "Bowdoin Bike School"), a community repair shop, as a shoestring popup that evolved into a storefront. Dreaming of expansion, De Amor worked with [Historic Boston Inc.](http://historicboston.org "Historic Boston Incorporated"), a nonprofit that works to repurpose at-risk historic buildings, to identify a good place to open a welcoming bike repair shop and coffee shop. They pointed him to a long-abandoned “comfort
station” — a [briefly popular
euphemism](https://books.google.com/ngrams/graph?content=comfort+station%2Crestroom%2Cwashroom&case_insensitive=on&year_start=1800&year_end=2000&corpus=17&smoothing=3&share=&direct_url=t4%3B%2Ccomfort%20station%3B%2Cc0%3B%2Cs0%3B%3Bcomfort%20station%3B%2Cc0%3B%3BComfort%20Station%3B%2Cc0%3B%3BCOMFORT%20STATION%3B%2Cc0%3B%3BComfort%20station%3B%2Cc0%3B.t4%3B%2Crestroom%3B%2Cc0%3B%2Cs0%3B%3Brestroom%3B%2Cc0%3B%3BRestroom%3B%2Cc0%3B%3BRESTROOM%3B%2Cc0%3B.t4%3B%2Cwashroom%3B%2Cc0%3B%2Cs0%3B%3Bwashroom%3B%2Cc0%3B%3BWashroom%3B%2Cc0%3B%3BWASHROOM%3B%2Cc0

The transformation effort is approaching success. If it wins a [voting contest](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/voteyourmainstreet/#/ "Vote Your Main Street") co-sponsored by National Geographic and the National Trust for Historic Preservation, its chances of becoming reality get even better.
