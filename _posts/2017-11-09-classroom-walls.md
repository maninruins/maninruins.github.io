This is my third year volunteering with an awesome local organization as a mentor for immigrant high school students. We meet once a week, in the evening, in a classroom at the high school. My student was late today — he had some “drama” to deal with — so I sat for a while looking around. I think I’d forgotten what a high school classroom looks like. They’re so personal and idiosyncratic. A poster from A Clockwork Orange. A quote from Dalí: “Intelligence without ambition is a bird without
wings.” That one, as you might suspect, is [apocryphal](https://quoteinvestigator.com/2015/10/14/wings/). Ironically (or not?): A poster with Lincoln’s photograph next to “Don’t believe everything you read on the internet just because there’s a picture with a quote next to it.”

What would you put on the walls of your classroom?
