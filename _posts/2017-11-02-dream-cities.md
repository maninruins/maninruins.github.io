 didn’t have much time to write today, but I did get to listen to last week’s episode of _[There Goes the Neighborhood: Los Angeles](http://www.wnyc.org/shows/neighborhood/ "There Goes the Neighborhood")_, a podcast co-produced by WNYC and KCRW. I liked the first season, which focused on Brooklyn, and am enjoying the second season even more. In this episode, one of the lead reporters, Saul Gonzalez, talks to an historian named Wade Graham on the banks of the Los Angeles River about the city’s
 environmental history. I looked him up, because the name sounded familiar. I realized it’s because he published a book last year, _[Dream Cities](https://wadegraham.com/dream-cities "Dream Cities")_, that I’ve spotted a few times in bookstores but never got around to picking up. Now it’s actually in the queue.
